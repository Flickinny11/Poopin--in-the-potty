	•	Accessibility: High-contrast mode, large text options
4. Monetization Model
Freemium with Premium Upsell:
	•	Free Tier: Limited video call minutes per month, basic translation (ad-supported)
	•	Premium Subscription: $9.99/month for unlimited calls, HD video, advanced translation, group calls, and recording
	•	Pay-Per-Use: $0.99 for 30-minute translation pass (for travelers or occasional users)
	•	Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for businesses (integration, analytics, admin controls)
Revenue Drivers:
	•	Premium conversions (target: 5-10% of free users)
	•	Pay-per-use for non-subscribers
	•	Enterprise contracts for global teams
5. Technical Integration
Since you can code the app and handle video streaming:
	•	You do NOT need a third-party video call API if you build your own video infrastructure (using WebRTC or similar).
	•	You DO need a translation/lipsync API: integrate HeyGen for real-time translation and lipsync, or Vozo AI for advanced dubbing if you need asynchronous translation.
Optional:
	•	Use Google or Microsoft APIs for fallback/basic translation if cost is an issue, but they do not provide lipsync.
6. Standalone vs. Integration
	•	Standalone launch is best for speed and control.
	•	Future: Offer plugins/integrations for Teams, Zoom, etc., once core user base and product stability are achieved.
7. VidLingo leverages the latest in AI translation and lipsync to deliver natural, engaging, and barrier-free video conversations—maximizing user engagement, retention, and monetization potential.

API Key Management & Rate Limiting Solution for HeyGen
1. Key Management & Scaling Approach
	•	Multiple API Keys: Since you can’t get an enterprise key at launch, register several HeyGen accounts (as allowed by their TOS) and obtain separate API keys for each.
	•	Backend Key Pool: Store all API keys securely on your backend (never in the client). Use a database or encrypted environment variables.
	•	Key Rotation Logic: Implement a load balancer in your backend to assign keys per request. Distribute traffic evenly to avoid hitting the per-key rate limit.
	•	Rate Limit Monitoring: Track usage for each key. If a key approaches its quota, automatically switch to another key in the pool.
	•	Exponential Backoff & Retry: On 429 (rate limit) errors, use exponential backoff before retrying with another key.
	•	Token Refresh (OAuth): If using OAuth for user-specific actions, manage access/refresh tokens as described in HeyGen’s docs. For API-key access, rotate keys only.
	•	Alerting: Set up automated alerts for failed requests or when any key nears its limit.

Other Important Planning Details
	•	Security: Store all API keys and tokens server-side, use HTTPS everywhere, encrypt sensitive data

	•	Scalability: Design backend to add/remove keys easily; use cloud functions or containerized microservices for scaling
	•	User Experience: Prioritize low-latency translation, clear error messages, and seamless upgrade flow
	•	Analytics: Track usage, conversion, retention, and error rates for rapid iteration
Summary:
Build a backend-managed API key pool with automatic rotation and rate limit handling. Use modern, minimalist UI/UX with clear upgrade paths. Start with a freemium model, upsell premium, and scale your backend as user demand grows. Use Swift/Kotlin for native apps, Node.js/Python for backend, and WebRTC for video. Always keep API keys secure and never in the client.
